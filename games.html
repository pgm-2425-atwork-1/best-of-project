            <p>
                2019 is the year that I properly got into sim racing. After visiting a friend and
                trying his rig I was convinced I wanted to spend some time exploring sim racing. It
                is a ton of fun, and combined with an interest in F1 and rally, a lot of my leisure
                time in 2019 had just one theme: racing.
            </p>

            <p>Looking back at the blog posts on my blog about sim racing (1, 2, 3, 4) I was
                clearly always going a bit deeper into sim racing. The past few weeks have been so
                busy with work that I haven't had much time to race. I think I reached a point
                where I believe I need to put hundred of hours into it to improve just a little
                bit. For me, it's always been about the fun. Of course, being competitive is also
                fun. But I can't justify it to myself to spend hours and hours behind the sim rig
                to shave off a few seconds off a track time. So I think in 2020 I am just going to
                race less, but focus on the parts that are fun to me: discovering new tracks, new
                cars, maybe some racing with friends.</p>

            <h4>Honorable Mentions</h4>
            <p>Observation: I have a penchant for deep simulation games, but these can take
                hundreds of hours, so I kind of only got to play them a little bit. Still; I find
                these games are still nice, even if it's only for a few hours.</p>
